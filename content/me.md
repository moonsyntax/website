Our team of experts at Moon Syntax recently recovered 2.1 BTC (Bitcoin) from a severely damaged OnePlus 7T device. This shows our commitment to excellence and our proficiency in cryptocurrency recovery services.

Our client relied on the Samurai wallet on Android, known for its top-notch security. The client’s Android device suffered a complete breakdown, leaving both the display and motherboard unusable. They remembered 12 out of the 13 words of their wallet passphrase, with the elusive 13th word being the “BIP passphrase.”

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the client tried recovering their funds using alternative wallets like Electrum, employing the known 12 words. Unfortunately, these attempts were futile, as the missing 13th word was essential for accessing the funds.

## Assessment

When the client approached us for assistance, they couldn’t provide a definitive answer regarding the length of the 13th word. Uncertainty surrounded whether it exceeded 12 letters or not. This posed a significant challenge to our recovery efforts. To address this ambiguity, we devised a two-pronged strategy.

## Approach

### Recover the Phone and Access the Wallet:

Our first option was to recover the damaged Android device. This was a complex and time-consuming process that required technical expertise and the right equipment. We understood that this approach had its own set of challenges, but it was essential to explore every possibility to retrieve the lost funds.

### Brute Force the 13th Word:

Recognizing that the recovery of the device might not be guaranteed, we simultaneously initiated a plan to brute force the missing 13th word. We prepared for an extensive and exhaustive process that involved attempting every possible combination of dictionary words and symbols until the correct word was found. This was no small task, and we knew it would require a dedicated system and considerable time.

## Result

In a fortunate turn of events, our efforts paid off. The damaged Android device was successfully recovered, and we gained access to the Samurai wallet. Our client’s funds were once again within reach. The successful recovery of the lost cryptocurrency was a testament to our team’s dedication, technical expertise, and innovative approach.
